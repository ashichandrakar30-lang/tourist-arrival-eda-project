# Tourist Arrival Data Analysis

## About the Project

This project analyzes tourist arrival data using Python to understand trends across months and years. It uses both bar charts and line charts to visualize tourist numbers and trends clearly.

## Dataset

The dataset contains monthly data for the years 2018 and 2019, including:

* Year
* Month
* Season
* Domestic_Tourists
* Foreign_Tourists
* Total_Tourists

## Tools

* Python
* Pandas (for data handling)
* Matplotlib (for charts)

## Steps Performed

1. Load the dataset using Pandas and check the first few rows.
2. Verify dataset information using `df.info()`.
3. Create a new column combining Month and Year for better visualization.
4. Plot a **bar chart** to show total tourists for each month-year.
5. Plot a **line chart** to show the trend of tourist arrivals over time.

## Visualizations

* **Bar Chart:** Displays the total number of tourists for each month-year combination.
* **Line Chart:** Shows the trend and pattern of tourist arrivals over time with markers for clarity.

## Insights

Tourist arrivals vary by month and season. Some months show higher tourist numbers than others. The line chart helps identify trends and patterns over the two years.

## How to Run

1. Place `tourist_data.csv` in the same folder as this Python script.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Both bar and line charts will be displayed automatically.


## Conclusion

The analysis shows that tourist arrivals are influenced by seasons and months. Peak months can be easily identified using bar charts, and overall trends over time are visible through line charts. This information can help in planning for tourism-related activities and resource management.
