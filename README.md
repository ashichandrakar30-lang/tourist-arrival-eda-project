TOURIST ARRIVAL EDA PROJECT


Project Title: Tourist Arrival Data Analysis

Objective:

* Explore tourist arrival data
* Identify trends and patterns
* Visualize using charts

Dataset:

* File: tourist_data.csv
* Columns: y (total tourists), f1–f41 (monthly/other features), Year, Month, Index

Tools:

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

Steps:

1. Loaded CSV file and checked the data.
2. Plotted line chart of tourist arrivals over time. (Paste chart here)
3. Plotted histogram to see distribution of tourists. (Paste chart here)
4. Calculated correlation of features with y and selected top features.
5. Plotted scatter plots of top features vs y. (Paste charts here)
6. Plotted average trend of monthly features f1–f41. (Paste chart here)

Observations:

* Tourist arrivals show seasonal and yearly trends.
* Top features have strong relation with tourist numbers.
* Monthly features show repeating patterns.

How to Run:

1. Install Python 3, Pandas, and Matplotlib:
   pip install pandas matplotlib
2. Place CSV in the same folder as the script.
3. Run script:
   python tourist_arrival_data_analysis.py

Conclusion:

* EDA and charts help understand tourist arrival trends and patterns.
* Charts clearly show peak months, distribution, and t
